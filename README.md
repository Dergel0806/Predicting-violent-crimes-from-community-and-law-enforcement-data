# Predicting violent crimes from community and law enforcement data

## Objective of the proposed research


**Stakeholder:** *US police departments*  
This stakeholder was selected due to high importance of police departments duties. Following research will give stakeholder information for situation analyse and effective resource managing, which will have positive effect on social security of population.

**Impact on stakeholder:** 
- prediction of future crime rate when opening new stations
- understanding of how efficiency of law enforcement will be affected by increasing or decreasing the following parameters:
    - police operating budget
    - number of police cars
    - number of police officers
    - etc.
- finding optimal quantity of law enforcement resources for specific population and city conditions    

**Planned goal variable:** `total number of violent crimes per 100K population`.  
This variable depicts total number of violent crimes per 100K popuation as is numerical (decimal).  
As most of the variables in the dataset, it is normalized between 0 and 1.

**Planned research and goals:**  
- analyze data 
- find predictors and strength of their impact
- create an accurate model that fits data
- try to answer questions like
    - does number of educated people impact crime rate?
    - does english-proficiency level among population impact crime rate?
    - does population density impact crime rate?
    - do housing conditions impact crime rate?
    - does race percentage have impact on crime rate?
    - etc.

**Dataset selection:**
For this research we have selected [this dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/communities+and+crime).  
This dataset combines data of 3 different aspects - socio-economic, law enforcement data and crime data. This dataset fits the research perfectly since it has socio-economic data, which may be major reason of crimes are commitment.  
Having data regarding law enforcement is also useful because it will show impact of law enforcement departments on to rise or drop of crime in different communites.  
It has large amount of columns that can be potential indicators relating to socio-economic, law enforcement and crime data. Also, this data is generally available and not confidential, which will allow efficient implementation of goals after completing this research.  
This dataset has 1994 rows, which should be enough for efficient modelling.
